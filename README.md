# CNN-LSTM-Image-Caption-Generator
It's a Machine Learning model that uses CNN for Image extraction and LSTM for Caption generation. It generates description for the image using fliker8k dataset.
This model was built and trained with the help of python programming because of it's vast and rich libraries, which play a key role in the training and development of the Machine Learning Model.
